# 2019_importance_subsampling
Data and model files for preprint "Importance Subsampling: Improving Power System Planning Under Climate-based Uncertainty (2019)"


## Notes 
- Before running the model, the data/demand_wind.csv should be split into two different .csv files, called data/demand.csv and data/wind.csv, with the correct demand and wind capacity factors. All demand values should be multipled by -1. The files data/demand.csv and data/wind.csv are provided as an example of the correct format.
- The version of Calliope used is 0.6.2.


## Contains:
- data/demand_wind.csv: dataset with estimates of hourly UK-wide demand levels and wind capacity factors over the period 1980-2015. All leap days (29-Feb) are removed.
- data/demand.csv: example of file format for the correct data/demand.csv file. The values from the 'demand' column in data/demand_wind.csv should be inserted here. All values should be negative.
- data/wind.csv: example of file format for the correct data/wind.csv file. The values from the 'wind' column in data/demand_wind.csv should be inserted here.
- model.yaml: main file used to Calliope model
- locations.yaml: locations file used in creating Calliope model. 
- techs.yaml: technology characteristics file used in creating Calliope model.
