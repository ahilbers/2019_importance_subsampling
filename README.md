# 2019_importance_subsampling
Data, model files, example code and supplementary material related to the paper _Importance Subsampling: Improving Power System Planning Under Climate-based Uncertainty (2019)_.

This repository contains:
- All data & model files used in the power system model (PSM) used in the paper.
- Sample code applying the _importance subsampling_ methodology to the test-case PSM, generating a full set of PSM outputs.
- Supplementary material related to the paper.




## Contains

### Modelling & data files

All files required to create the PSM. 

- 'model_files/': repository containing all model files (in the correct format) for the employed PSM. It is created in the open source model generator _Calliope_ (see acknowledgements), version 0.6.2
- 'data/': repository containing data files
  - 'demand_wind.csv': demand and wind timeseries used in paper, across 36-year period 1980-2015
  - 'demand_wind_national_grid.csv': demand and wind timeseries used in supplementary material


### Sample code

Sample code that builds the PSM and runs it using timeseries data subsampled using the _importance subsampling_ methodology. The code is designed to run with 'Python' 3.6 with 'numpy' and 'pandas' and _Calliope_ version 0.6.2.

The code can be run as follows from a unix command line:

    $ source activate calliope
    (calliope) $ python3 main.py

A directory outputs is created with all relevant PSM outputs.

- 'main.py': main python script
- 'scripts.py': relevant definitions and scripts.


### Supplementary material

- 'supplementary_material.pdf': PDF file with results of applying _importance subsampling_ to the demand_wind_national_grid.csv timeseries data instead of demand_wind.csv as in the paper.
