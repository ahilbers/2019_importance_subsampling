# 2019_importance_subsampling
Data, model files, example code and supplementary material related to the paper [Importance subsampling: improving power system planning under climate-based uncertainty](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261919307639) (2019). A publicly available preprint can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.10916.pdf). 




## Contains

### Modelling & data files

- `model_files/`: power system model generating files, for `Calliope` (see acknowledgements)
- `data/`: demand and weather time series data
  - `demand_wind.csv`: demand and wind time series used in paper
  - `demand_wind_national_grid.csv`: demand and wind time series used in supplementary material


### Code

`main.py` contains a simple implementation of _importance subsampling_ on the power system model introduced in the paper. This model is created and solved in the open-source energy system modelling framework `Calliope` (see acknowledgements). See _requirements & installation_ for setup details. `main.py` can be run directly from a command line.



Assuming `Calliope` is installed in an anaconda virtual environment called `calliope`, an example simulation can be run from a unix command line as follows:

    $ conda activate calliope       # activate virtual environment
    (calliope) $ python3 main.py    # run code

A directory `results` is created with all relevant PSM outputs.


### Supplementary material

- `supplementary_material.pdf`: PDF file with results of applying _importance subsampling_ to the `demand_wind_national_grid.csv` time series data instead of `demand_wind.csv` as in the original paper




## Requirements & Installation

Since `main.py`, containing all code, is a short file with only a few functions, it's probably easier to directly copy-paste any relevant code into a personal project as opposed to installing a new module. For this reason, this repository does not contain a `setup.py` file.

Running `main.py` requires:
- Python modules:
  - `Calliope 0.64`:  see [this link](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installation.html) for installation. By default, `Calliope` is installed in a virtual environment, which we assume is called `calliope`.
  - `numpy 1.62.2`
  - `pandas 0.24.2`
- Other:
  - `cbc`: open-source optimiser: see [this link](https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc) for installation. Other solvers (e.g. `gurobi`) are also possible -- the solver can be specified in `model_files/model.yaml`.
