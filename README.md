# 2019_importance_subsampling
Data, model files, example code and supplementary material related to the paper _Importance subsampling: improving power system planning under climate-based uncertainty (2019)_.




## Contains

### Modelling & data files

- `model_files/`: repository containing all model files for the employed PSM, in open source model generator _Calliope_ (see acknowledgements), version 0.6.2
- `data/`: repository containing data files. These can be substituted into the `model_files/data/demand.csv` and `model_files/data/wind_r.csv` (but be careful to respect the style in those files to ensure the PSM is built correctly, e.g. multiply demand by -1!)
  - `demand_wind.csv`: demand and wind timeseries used in paper
  - `demand_wind_national_grid.csv`: demand and wind timeseries used in supplementary material


### Sample code

Sample code executing the _importance subsampling_ methodology on the PSM used in the paper. Designed to run with `Python` 3.6 with `numpy` and `pandas` and _Calliope_ version 0.6.2. It is run as follows from a unix command line. Note that you need to install _Calliope_ (see acknowledgements) first!

    $ source activate calliope      # start Calliope environment
    (calliope) $ python3 main.py    # run code

A directory `outputs` is created with all relevant PSM outputs.


### Supplementary material

- `supplementary_material.pdf`: PDF file with results of applying _importance subsampling_ to the demand_wind_national_grid.csv timeseries data instead of demand_wind.csv as in the paper.
