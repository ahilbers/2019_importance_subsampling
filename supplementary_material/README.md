# Supplementary material

This directory contains a larger number of plots corresponding to Figure 2 in the paper. These plots show the distribution of optimal capacities and suboptimality metrics (peak capacity shortage, energy unserved) across 100 samples generated by different subsampling methods. The box-and-whiskers show the 2.5%, 25%, median, 75% and 97.5% percentiles. The optima across the full time series (targets) are shown as a dashed black line.

The names of the files mean the following.
- `caps`, `caps_full`, `peak_unmet`, `gen_unmet` mean the systemwide total optimal installed capacities, the same plots at regional (bus) level (e.g. `PK_R3` means peaking capacity in region 3), the systemwide capacity shortage, and the systemwide energy unserved respectively.
